# Logo for Hung-Su

## The current state

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hungsu/hung.su-2018/master/images/logo--black.png" alt="Hung-Su logo" title="Hung-Su" height="120" />

Observe how when the logo is compared to modern logos as found by searching for "logo" on Dribbble, the logo looks rather wonky and amateur.

Also looks awful as a favicon
